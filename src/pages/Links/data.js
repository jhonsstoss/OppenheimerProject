Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called "father of the atomic bomb" who headed up the Manhattan Project during World War II.

"To be able to pick up the phone, be like, This is the one where you carry the movie and really get to show what you can do, its honestly one of my favorite moments in the movie business, when I had that conversation."',

'I went and met Chris in L.A.,' the actress explained during EW's Around the Table conversation, which took place before the start of the SAG-AFTRA strike. 'So we talked for an hour or so, and then he's just very casual, and he goes, 'So it's the part of his wife and I'd love you to take a look at it.' And you're like, is this an offer? [Laughs] So I went into the living room and read the script and it was just so heart-racing. It was so awesome.'",

Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project who appointed Oppenheimer to directly oversee the development of the atomic bomb. 'I was so blown away by the script,' the Bourne franchise star said. 'It's in the first person, which I'd never seen before. So rather than say, 'Oppenheimer crosses the room' it says 'I walk across the room.' It has a visceral effect on you, and it pulls you right in, which is the point.'",

When Downey was first given the script for Oppenheimer, at Nolan's house, he was surprised to discover the screenplay came on red paper, for security reasons. 'I guess there's something about it that makes it that you forget it as soon as you read it,' joked Downey. 'I don't know what those colors are. Anyway, it's a thing. You read the script, it's written in the first person, you're transported, and it's a journey to read it, and then at the end of that, the guy who wrote the script you just read is asking you if you want to do it. It's kind of like being hypnotized.'",

Eighteen years on, the Ant-Man and Blade Runner 2049 actor plays Borden, a staff member of Congress' Joint Atomic Energy Committee. 'I didn't even think he remembered me,' the actor said of Nolan in an interview that took place before the actors' strike. 'I didn't even think he would know who I was. It turns out I was wrong, and he gave me an opportunity to come and play in his incredible creative space, with some of the best actors of our time, all of whom treated me so kindly, and welcomed me, and made me feel like I belonged.'",

He was very, very busy when I asked him to take on the role of Teller, but I think he just really wanted to do it because of his love of and knowledge of physics.'",
